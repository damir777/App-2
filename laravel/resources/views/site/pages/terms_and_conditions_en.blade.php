                <h5>Payment schedule</h5>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Booking payments may be made by bank transfer (bank charges are borne by the guest) or by a credit card (bank charges
                    are borne by the agency). Guests requiring a visa to enter the Republic of Croatia cannot use credit cards to pay for
                    their booking. In credit card payments, the payer’s account will be charged for the HRK counter-value indicated in
                    the request for payment, calculated according to the selling rate of Raiffeisen Bank. Possible minimum differences
                    in the exchange rate will be charged to the guest’s account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To confirm the booking, the guest pays a certain percentage of the total amount. The remaining part of the total
                    amount of the holiday package is paid by the guest on the day of their arrival, in cash, directly to the
                    accommodation owner. In case of hotels and tourist resorts, the remaining amount must be paid no later than 21 days
                    prior to arrival, either by credit card or by direct payment to the accommodation provider’s bank account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you wish to pay for your booking via bank transfer, you must pay the relevant amount within 24 hours from the
                    moment you make the online booking or receive the offer from our operator. In addition, immediately after the payment
                    is made, you are obligated to send a payment confirmation to xx – by e-mail or fax. Otherwise,
                    xx is not obligated to make the reservation. All bank charges relating to transfer are borne by the
                    client (therefore, please choose the “OUR” option when making a transfer).
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Payments from Croatia to the Company’s gyro-account<br>

                <p>
                    2. International money transfer<br>
                    This payment method is available only to foreign clients. The amount of the booking value must be transferred to
                    the foreign currency account. Charges of the sending bank and of the receiving bank are borne entirely by the guest,
                    except when payment is made from EU Member States, in which case there are no additional charges for foreign
                    currency payments.
                </p>
                <p>

                    xx undertakes to protect all the personal data of the customers by collecting only necessary, basic
                    data about the customers/users, required for the fulfilment of our obligations; to inform customers of how the
                    collected data is used; to regularly give customers the possibility to choose how they want their information to be
                    used, including the possibility to opt whether or not they want their name to be excluded from the lists used for
                    marketing campaigns. All the customer data are securely stored and made available only to employees who require such
                    data to perform their work. All employees of xx and business partners are responsible for compliance
                    with personal data protection principles.

                <p>
                    After the down payment is made, you will receive a payment confirmation and details of your booking, as well as a

                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Complaints</h5>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If the services from our offer are provided poorly, the guest may request a reasonable compensation by submitting a
                    written complaint. Every guest is entitled to file a complaint regarding the services paid but unrendered. Every
                    guest – holder of a confirmed booking, files an individual complaint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The guest is obligated to promptly, on the date of arrival, file a complaint on an inappropriate service with a
                    representative of the service provider (reception clerk or the owner of accommodation, etc.) and inform the
                    agency’s office about it by e-mail, at info@xx.com or by phone, to +385 31 445 490 and +385 99 444 8488.
                    The guest is obligated to cooperate in good faith with the service provider and the agency to rectify the causes of
                    the complaint. If the guest accepts a proposed solution there and then, the agency is not obligated to accept any
                    subsequent complaints.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the problem has not been not solved even after the on-site intervention, the guest is obligated to file a written
                    complaint with the agency no later than within 8 days after returning from the trip, enclosing the accompanying
                    documents and photographs proving the basis for the complaint. The complaint and accompanying documents should be
                    sent to the agency either by e-mail, at info@xx.com or by regular mail, to the address xx. Only fully documented complaints received within 8 days after completion of
                    the booking will be taken into consideration by the agency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the process of solving the complaint is pending, for a maximum total of 14 or 28 days after the complaint has
                    been filed, the guest irrevocably waves the right to have the matter mediated by any other person, the right to
                    arbitration by the Association of Croatian Travel Agencies (UHPA) or by any other institution, as well as the right
                    to share any information with the media. In addition, during that period, the guest waves the right to file a lawsuit.
                    The highest amount of compensation based on a complaint may reach the amount corresponding to the part of services
                    included in the complaint, and it cannot include already used services or the total amount of the holiday package.
                    This excludes the guest’s right to ideal damage compensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The agency cannot be held liable for weather conditions or cleanliness or temperature of the sea in any destination,
                    or for any other similar situations and events that may result in guests’ dissatisfaction but are not directly
                    related to quality of the booked accommodation unit (e.g. lack of sunlight, bad weather, poorly maintained beaches,
                    overcrowdedness, stolen or damaged property, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the guest enters into a tour agreement on the “last minute booking” basis, the guest accepts all the inherent
                    risks of such an arrangement. Such arrangements include uncertain facts that are beyond the agency’s control and the
                    guest has accepted such an arrangement primarily due to a lower price. Therefore, the guest has no right to a
                    complaint against the tour operator.
                </p>
                <br>
